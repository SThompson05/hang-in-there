# Hang in There  

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
The "Hang in There" application was developed to enable users to create motivational posters by randomizing a picture, title, and quote. Users can save these posters and view them in their collection. Additionally, the application allows users to create custom posters by selecting an image online, assigning a title, adding a quote, and saving the poster. The app also features a collection of comical un-motivational posters. Users can remove any posters they dislike from their collection by double-clicking on them.

The problem the "Hang in There" application addresses is the need for quick, easy-to-create, personalized motivational content. People often seek inspiration but may not have the time or resources to create motivational posters from scratch. Additionally, while motivational content is widely available, it can sometimes feel generic or impersonal. On the flip side, some people enjoy humor through un-motivational or sarcastic content, which is less readily available in customizable formats.

The application solves this problem by providing a platform where users can generate motivational posters with minimal effort. By randomizing the picture, title, and quote, it offers instant inspiration tailored to the user's taste. The ability to customize posters by selecting an image, adding a title, and crafting a quote further allows users to create content that resonates personally with them. Additionally, the inclusion of un-motivational posters adds a humorous twist, appealing to users who enjoy sarcasm or irony. The easy-to-use interface, coupled with the option to save and manage a personal collection, makes it convenient for users to keep their favorite posters or remove those that don’t suit their preferences.


### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
The repository for the application can be found on my Github <u>[found here](https://github.com/SThompson05/hang-in-there)</u>. To get your own copy, fork the repository and then clone it. To clone it to your local machine, you'll open the terminal and paste the SSH link from GitHub. In your terminal type "<i>git clone</i>" and paste the GitHub link and press enter. It should look something like this: <br><br><i> <a href="https://www.example.com" style="text-decoration: none; color: white;">git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git.</a></i><br><br>
To run the application, follow these steps:
1. <b>Open Terminal:</b> Launch your terminal or command prompt.
2. <b>Navigate to the Project Directory:</b> Use the cd (change directory) command to move into the hang-in-there directory: cd path/to/hang-in-there
3. <b>Open the HTML File:</b> To view the application, open the index.html file in your default web browser:<br>
    * <b>On macOS, use:</b> open index.html<br>
    * <b>On Windows, use:</b> start index.html 


These steps will allow you to run and view the index.html file, and will open the default web browser so that you can interact with the full application.

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
Seven weeks into Turing, we were introduced to our first front-end project at the start of module two, where we began our deep dive into front-end development. We had 10 days to complete the project, an intense but rewarding experience as we simultaneously learned and applied JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to build the application.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
In this project, I focused on improving my ability to read, understand, and work with existing codebases while writing clean, DRY JavaScript that adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). I implemented dynamic functionality by manipulating the DOM—adding, removing, and updating elements after the page had loaded. Additionally, I utilized array prototype iterator methods to transform data and render it on the DOM. I also applied CSS and HTML to accurately match the styling and layout provided in the design comps.

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
A major win was gaining confidence in manipulating the DOM. I successfully added, removed, and updated elements dynamically, which significantly enhanced the interactivity of the application.<br><br>
I was able to write clean, maintainable code by adhering to DRY principles and utilizing functions that followed the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). This made my code more organized and easier to debug.<br><br>
Implementing responsive design using CSS flexbox was another win. It allowed the layout to adjust seamlessly across different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience.<br><br>
Initially, I struggled with understanding how to effectively use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM and handle events. To overcome this, I spent extra time reading documentation, practicing with smaller code snippets, and seeking help from peers and instructors when I got stuck.<br><br>
Debugging asynchronous code was another challenge, particularly when handling user interactions that updated the DOM. I got through this by using console logs extensively to trace the flow of data and by breaking down complex functions into smaller, manageable parts to isolate issues more effectively.
